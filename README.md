🐍 Snake Game in the Browser URL Bar

This project is a fun and experimental Snake Game that runs directly inside your browser’s URL address bar instead of a regular web page. You can play the game, track your score, and enjoy a unique twist on a classic concept — right where you’d normally see a website’s URL!

Please note:
The project is still under development and may contain a few bugs.
Some browsers might not support it due to restrictions on frequently changing the URL or not displaying it fully.
For the best experience, try it on different browsers and see which one works best.
